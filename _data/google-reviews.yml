  review: This place has been a God send for my Grandma. She cared for us and our kids when she was younger and unfortunately for us we cannot physically be there to care for her these gold years. Advantage seniors has taken it to another level and taken over our job with a smile.  Many of us have visited her and noticed how well she is cared for. God bless all those souls who care for our seniors with love, affection and compassion.

  review: The Advantage seniors facility is like a rare gem. Having visited multiple places, nothing came even close to this place in terms of cleanliness, good food, selfless service, a hands on competent team and the fact that they really care for the patients. I am eternally grateful to Soumya and her team for taking care of my aunt and granny in the best way. It is also the only care facility of its kind that I found to be transparent in their day to day operations and extend support like a real family. Thank you and your whole team for helping us out.

  review: My mother in law was bed ridden and was in bad condition initially. After we admitted her in advantage seniors she has undergone great changes and is completely fine now. Personalized care, home cooked food, and attention given by all care takers and staff makes her feel like home. Cleaniness and hygiene is impeccable. Dr.Soumya, Ms.Swetha & staff nurses are doing a great service for all. Thank them from my heart.

  review: Advantage seniors took care of both of my parents at the end of their lives. We had their care givers in our home for 5 years. Not once did we have a bad experience with a caregiver. The level of care and the compassion and caring spirit of the owners, managers, and the wonderful caregivers was incredible. Kudos! I can only hope to be so lucky.

  review: This place truly keeps up to  it's name 'Advantage'. My mother who is  diagnosed with Parkinson's and other age related problems is being well taken care of. She is very happy, loves the food that is served, usually it is the food that is always complained, so this speaks for it.  Nursing care and cleanliness is upto the mark. Great endeavour by Sowmya, the very fact my mother considers Sowmya as one of her daughters speaks volumes for itself. Please contiune the noble job you are doing. Thank you once again from the bottom of my heart for looking after my mother.

  review: One of the best center for taking care of old aged/deceased patients/citizens. The facility is almost like a very clean hotel. I never found this kind of nice facility/treatment for aged/deceased people anywhere in and around Mangalore/Bangalore. Hats off to Roshan Jacob Sir and Soumya Madam. They are the role models in this type selfless service

  review: I had admitted my paternal uncle last year in July. The nursing staff took good care of him during his stay there. The place is "spic & span". Kudos to Ms Soumya Laxmi for managing her team in a professional manner. Ms Soumya is the "soul & heart" of this initiative. Any issues raised by me was immediately attended to by her. She takes an empathetic outlook regarding the work that she does & tries to mentor her team members accordingly.

  review: >
    "My recommendation is based on my assessment of Advantage on five key attributes important to families of residents - 1. CAPABILITY:  They provide the best care possible in the circusmtances, constantly guiding the family to determine the best course of action depending on the situation.  As experts in the field of gerontology, they are passionate about what they do, and are well connected to specialists and hospitals when the need arises.
    2. PASSION & COMPASSION:  Out of a passion for elder care arises compassion in the quality of care.  Advantage is not run solely for business purposes, so your loved one is cared for with compassion regardless of their physical or mental state.
    3. HIGHER MISSION: Their passion for the care of elders drives them to be visionaries in the field of elder care in India, which is in its relative infancy.  They have studied global care models and have applied them to the Indian situation to provide care that is competitive from a cost and quality standpoint.
    4. FLEXIBILITY: They have provided many years of in home care when all that was needed was a 'round-the-clock helping hand, but when that became unsustainable, the tranisition for our loved one to the care home was easier
    5. CLEANLINESS, HYGIENE AND NUTRITION:  After numerous visits, I can attest to a very high standard of cleanliness and hygiene.  Residents dietary needs are considered and their diet is customized to their needs."
