  review: This place has been a God send for my Grandma. She cared for us and our kids when she was younger and unfortunately for us we cannot physically be there to care for her these gold years. Advantage seniors has taken it to another level and taken over our job with a smile.  Many of us have visited her and noticed how well she is cared for. God bless all those souls who care for our seniors with love, affection and compassion.

  review: The Advantage seniors facility is like a rare gem. Having visited multiple places, nothing came even close to this place in terms of cleanliness, good food, selfless service, a hands on competent team and the fact that they really care for the patients. I am eternally grateful to Soumya and her team for taking care of my aunt and granny in the best way. It is also the only care facility of its kind that I found to be transparent in their day to day operations and extend support like a real family. Thank you and your whole team for helping us out.

  review: My mother in law was bed ridden and was in bad condition initially. After we admitted her in advantage seniors she has undergone great changes and is completely fine now. Personalized care, home cooked food, and attention given by all care takers and staff makes her feel like home. Cleaniness and hygiene is impeccable. Dr.Soumya, Ms.Swetha & staff nurses are doing a great service for all. Thank them from my heart.

  review: Advantage seniors took care of both of my parents at the end of their lives. We had their care givers in our home for 5 years. Not once did we have a bad experience with a caregiver. The level of care and the compassion and caring spirit of the owners, managers, and the wonderful caregivers was incredible. Kudos! I can only hope to be so lucky.

  review: This place truly keeps up to  it's name 'Advantage'. My mother who is  diagnosed with Parkinson's and other age related problems is being well taken care of. She is very happy, loves the food that is served, usually it is the food that is always complained, so this speaks for it.  Nursing care and cleanliness is upto the mark. Great endeavour by Sowmya, the very fact my mother considers Sowmya as one of her daughters speaks volumes for itself. Please contiune the noble job you are doing. Thank you once again from the bottom of my heart for looking after my mother.

  review: I had admitted my paternal uncle last year in July. The nursing staff took good care of him during his stay there. The place is "spic & span". Kudos to Ms Soumya Laxmi for managing her team in a professional manner. Ms Soumya is the "soul & heart" of this initiative. Any issues raised by me was immediately attended to by her. She takes an empathetic outlook regarding the work that she does & tries to mentor her team members accordingly.

  review: >
    "My recommendation is based on my assessment of Advantage on five key attributes important to families of residents - 1. CAPABILITY:  They provide the best care possible in the circusmtances, constantly guiding the family to determine the best course of action depending on the situation.  As experts in the field of gerontology, they are passionate about what they do, and are well connected to specialists and hospitals when the need arises.
    2. PASSION & COMPASSION:  Out of a passion for elder care arises compassion in the quality of care.  Advantage is not run solely for business purposes, so your loved one is cared for with compassion regardless of their physical or mental state.
    3. HIGHER MISSION: Their passion for the care of elders drives them to be visionaries in the field of elder care in India, which is in its relative infancy.  They have studied global care models and have applied them to the Indian situation to provide care that is competitive from a cost and quality standpoint.
    4. FLEXIBILITY: They have provided many years of in home care when all that was needed was a 'round-the-clock helping hand, but when that became unsustainable, the tranisition for our loved one to the care home was easier
    5. CLEANLINESS, HYGIENE AND NUTRITION:  After numerous visits, I can attest to a very high standard of cleanliness and hygiene.  Residents dietary needs are considered and their diet is customized to their needs."

    1. Patient hygiene & overall cleanliness of the entire facility. 
    2. Management style; the staff are positively engaged in what they are doing. 
    3. Food quality & the eatables/drinks timetable they follow for patients. 
    4. Ms.Soumya, Mr.Roshan & their team are a group of compassionate people.

  review: My 82 year old father has been living at Advantage senior care since October 2015. I cannot say enough nice things about the management and people who work here. This  place has been a real home and family for my father. They are caring, empathetic yet highly professional and extremely knowledgeable in the area of senior care. My father has blossomed in their care and is so happy, that he will not move out of here. When my father first moved there, he was just recovering from a bad fall and was very disoriented. With the care and love he received at Advantage, he is now active, reads a lot and enjoys walks and conversations with the staff. I am so blessed to have found this superb care place. Ms. Soumya Nair who runs the home is like a daughter to my father and my advisor and friend at the same time. This is a gem of a home for your beloved parents, grandparents or elderly family members who need 24 hour care in a safe, loving and clean environment, one that you may not be able to provide in your own home. This is truly a home away from home.

Both of them are extremely professional, warm, good listeners and positively consider the feedback. they are resident centric, family friendly and are innovative (pet therapy) in their care.

  review: I got to know about this place through my friend as I was looking for a care home for my aged parents who required 24/7 care. This place was very homely and they took care of my parents extremely well. I could visit my parents any time , if need arises. Ms. Soumya Nair who runs the facility takes loving care of the inmates with fully trained staff. Her commitment in spite of many practical problems (like attrition of the staff, behavioural issues of the old inmates) is very commendable. She spends time with each inmate so that they don’t feel lonely. A big THANK YOU for your services .

  review: I am a 79 year old retired teacher. I would like to share my experience with advantage and its founders. I am so happy to have read so many good reviews about advantage seniors foundation here. I have no doubt in any of your experiences because I have experienced the same. I happened to meet Sowmya Nair when my husband was suffering with dementia and cancer both. My husband was a retired Doctor from the health department Govt. of Karnataka. This all happened in 2009 and that was the most difficult patch of my life as one of my daughter is a special child and my other child, my son lives away in Western Australia, Perth. I am severe arthritic past 17 years I suffer with extreme pain in my joints and almost needs help to function on a daily basis. I had no support on top of that I had to take care of my husband and my daughter at the same time. When I met Sowmya she was a young girl in her early 20s and I was little skeptical thinking what can she do about my problems. But I was clear I wanted to admit my husband and went ahead speaking to her exploring the options. I was terribly shocked by the maturity she showed at that age.  She had a thorough knowledge about elder care and it was enlightening. I even suggested her to write a book for those people who cannot come to her. Till today I remember the kind of support she gave me was unmatched. She explained many dimensions of my issues which I myself never thought of. Sowmya not alone kept my husband in her Nursing Care home and looked after him like her own father but also emerged to me as a biggest support of my life, like a daughter to me, which she doesn't have to do. When my husband died, I had no idea, rather I was completely at loss thinking what to do next, Sowmya stood by me until my husband's body was taken into the incinerator in Kalpilli Crematorium. She kept the body in the mortuary at midnight, took it out next morning, dressings done to my husband's body, cremation went well everything by herself with her team giving me enough time and space to mourn. At last when all rituals are over, She made sure I eat the sandwich she was carrying in her handbag, walked me till my car and saw me off.  Being an old woman I know what it means to be supported like this when you have no family around. It is not the revenue which they make from their work that drives her, it is definitely her selfless being and passion for caring. At that point I realized, I and my husband have helped, supported many people in our lives when my husband was taken into the funeral pyre no one actually was there by my side. It is a sad reality of life. Instead with full of love and compassion god had sent me one angel, and that was Sowmya Nair. I have the full satisfaction that from the day my husband was sick and till his last rituals, I have done full justice as a loyal wife and I am contented that I have done my duties well. Its all because of advantage seniors care help. It may look quite awkward to speak about someone so much good things but I cannot help it, such was the support given to me at the most needed time in my life. I am a spiritual person and I believe in god, when god cannot be everywhere he has created Earth Angels, to guard you, you come across them in various patches of your life, especially in most difficult periods, most are recognized most go unnoticed. I think Sowmya is one, and I recognized her. Being 79, now I am waiting for my turn to unite my husband I whole hardheartedly bless Sowmya and her team Honnama, Shwetha, Chaithra and everyone. Last but least, a big Special thanks to Roshan for creating such an organization to help older people like me. You are doing god's work and you are chosen for this work. Sowmya like I told you before, you will reach heights, one day world will recognize you. My blessings and Ramakrishna uncle's blessing will be with you always. Do continue with your mission to serve the humanity. Let me tell you that again you are an Earth Angel.

    "For about a year now, our Ajji (grandmother - V. Jayalaxmi) has been at a care facility run by Advantage Seniors. I love several things about the place (1) its philosophy is to foster independence in the elderly, as much as possible, (2) her caregivers are enthusiastic, fun-loving and nurturing women who care for both her physical and mental well-being (Ajji enjoys humor and they provide plenty of it), (3) they encourage visitors, and even go out of their way to accommodate schedules of out-of-towners, (4) when my sister, Sandhya, and I (Anu) visited her two months ago, Ajji was proudly showing us how she was walking with her walker, she was given food according to her prescribed diet, medicines were dispensed properly, her caregivers were kind and gentle, and the place was super clean (our family folks are sticklers for cleanliness and even we were impressed), (5) Soumya, the co- founder, keeps us posted on a regular basis with information about Ajji. Overall, I feel that Ajji has a strong connection with the warm and loving people who surround her every day, and is in a happy place. We are very fortunate and grateful to have found Advantage Seniors, a place where we know Ajji is cared for very well. Thank you Advantage Seniors, especially thank you dear Soumya  ! - with gratitude, Anu Agarwal, V. Jayalaxmi's (Ajji's) grand daughter"

  review: Taking care of elderly persons is a significant responsibility, especially when they require medical attention. I realised this when my father developed Parkinson's deasease, which I found when it was getting out of hand and the intervension of medical experts is inevitable. Realising this, I approached the Care Center [Senior Advantage Care Center] wherein I felt very happy to learn that the Center was run by experts in the field of caring the elder people. One of the main features of this Center is that they have state-of-the-art system of caring and medician for the above mentioned disease and we could witness the instant results. In a short span of 3 months, there is a considerable improvement in his general health condition. This is largely due to the tranquil conditions and the home-like atmosphere that prevails in this Center. I would recommend all those who are looking for providing proper and appropriate care should certainly visit this Center.

Your team is doing a great job for the society. Special thanks to the staff Milan, Nagaraj and Swetha. We use to visit every week to the care home and all the staff given us a warm welcome with smiling face. And they put all the efforts to give good support & care to the seniors. Thanks again for all the support. Though I have one suggestion, it will good if a small garden area stretched near to the care home.

  review: We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to advantAGE Seniors who are serving silently with a social concern and without any expectation to the old age patients who are suffering from various medical issues. Recently, we have admitted our father to advantAGE who is suffering from dimentia (memory related issues), since both of us are blind persons. The advantAGE cares the patients more than their family cares, where all the aspects including necessary medical treatment will be taken care. The patients can improve in such a way that they can lead their life from dependency to independency. We once again express my sincere thanks to advantAGE.

  review: Our dear sister, who was born deaf, led a wonderful life in spite of her handicap. At the young age of 18, way back in 1960, she went for further studies to Pennsylvania and Washington. On her return to India, she got a job with Canara Bank in their EDP section. She was one of the first deaf persons to get a job in a bank in India, and she worked there for 30 years. Her performance enabled many deaf persons get jobs in banks all over India. It was her endeavor to start a school for the deaf in Bangalore and she was successful at that too. However, she was struck with an even crueler affliction when she was in her 70’s. She was diagnosed with Parkinsons. The doctors told us that this was not the normal Parkinsons, but a more acute type caused by our dear mother having German measles when in full term of pregnancy. The doctors had warned us that her rate of deterioration would be very fast and sadly, that is what happened. Initially, we managed her at home with the help of a nurse, but as a couple of months passed, it became increasingly difficult. We did carry out a survey of various senior citizen care homes, but were not impressed by any of them. We were most reluctant to think of any other options until a doctor friend of ours recommended Advantage Seniors. This is when we came in contact with Ms. Soumya Nair and we were surprised at the immediate rapport she stuck up with our sister on their very first meeting, in spite of our sister being deaf. The next day we visited their office and had a meeting with Mr. Roshan and after a visit to the nursing home, we decided to shift our sister there. The care givers interacted with her in a loving and gentle manner and we could sense our sister was very comfortable with them. A caregiver was by her side 24X7 and the constant vigil exercised by Mr. Roshan and Ms. Soumya was commendable. We felt at peace that our sister was in safe hands. She was under their care for over 9 months until she breathed her last and we are eternally grateful to Ms. Soumya and the caregivers for having made our sister’s last months so comfortable. May God bless the facility and all the people associated with it a thousand fold.

  review: I’m at loss of words to appreciate the yeomen service rendered by the Management and Staff of Advantage Seniors, Bangalore. Two years ago, we had admitted our uncle, aged 86 years. Though he passed away within a fortnight, yet care was given to him till his last breath, without getting agitated and with unflinching nursing. A year ago, I had admitted my 68 years old sister, who is physically challenged since her age of two. She is more than happy to live there and is reluctant to get back home. The Staff are very cordial, caring, service oriented and ever smiling. I’m yet to catch anyone hesitant or unprofessional. Food is wholesome and served in time. Cleanliness is at its best.

  review: A well managed care home for elderly, those in need of assisted living, and other care functions. The staff is consistently good and well trained to provide the care that is sorely needed. The management is keenly tuned in to these requirements and ensure that nothing is found wanting. What stands out is the caretakers’ dedication, empathy and love for the residents. They face so much resistance from some residents suffering from Dementia, Alzheimer’s and other ailments yet they win them over with persistent love.  It is truly remarkable, when you observe them, that the caretakers who hail from the villages have so much natural flair for the supreme service of caregiving. I have often  watched as they feed the residents. It is amazing how old people behave like kids and how the caregivers, patiently and with humour, get them to co-operate and eat. It’s a blessed art. I have been utilising the care home’s services for over 5 years now for my family member, first at their Indiranagar facility and now at their current location in Athina Township, Bileshivale. The atmosphere  is homely. It doesn’t have that typical look one sees  in oldage homes. The place is clean, well set up and homely which itself works well for residents. The quality of care my brother gets here is high. It is a sad truth that after paying high wages we rarely obtain good caretakers at our homes. Despite constant supervision the person we love most has to suffer poor attention at the hands of inadequate caretakers.  However, Advantage fills this vacuum at its care home. Attention and affection are noteworthy.  The food is tasty and mealtimes are regular. Customised food as needed is provided. Respect their visit hours. Birthdays are noted and celebrated ! It is very touching when the caretakers get cakes and candles and decorate the room with festoons and balloons and make the Birthday Boy/Girl the centre of attraction and love. Truly memorable. One can see how desperately the country needs such services for the elderly and yet how few organisations exist to provide quality care. Advantage Seniors scores well in all parameters. Regular doctor visits, round-the-clock caretakers ever watchful yet  cheerfully tending to the residents. The professionals running the show here deserve great credit for their dedication and expertise in a great social service. Both Mr.Roshan Jacob and Ms.Soumya Nair are full fledged professionals with an  uncanny ability to read your domestic situation adroitly and recommend solutions.  Both are reputed in the field of gerontology and training of nursing professionals and have a natural flair to endear themselves to the people under their care. That is the first and last line in Caregiving.

  review: I came  across "Advantage Seniors care home" when my 90 years old  grand mom fell sick; 2 years back i had recently moved into Bangalore . My grand mother Rosamma  Paulose was suffering with Alzheimer's disease; in the initial stages it was  nightmarish experinece. Since my parents  moved to USA for my sister's delivery I had  shouldered the job of caring for my grand mom. My grand mom's condition was  such that she was wandering ; passing elimination without her knowledge; she refused bathing; would not take her medicines or eat food she was extremly violent ; throwing things and was restless 24/7. Someone  suggested 24/7 nurse aid. I tried various  organisation  they would come and run away in a day or two.Some agencies took money and did not send any carer; when called "the #u called is switched off" was  the response. Once aids who came  was  constantly hanging on the phone leaving my grand mom to wander on the road; when we came back from work  I found my grand mom was not at home, the nursing aid said  she had no clue. What a  nightmarish experience! When we ran out all options and we were desperate that is when one  of my colleague suggested me "advantage seniors". The  information  was  truly god sent! I called  Soumya Nair on her phone, unlike other agencies I had a difference in her approach: she patiently asked me what was grand mom's condition;what sort of support she  needed etc. At one  breath i walked her through  my helplessness and desperate  situation she asked me to meet her in person. Soumya insisted I come with  the lady of the house that was my wife.Initially my wife and i felt so strange  because to avail a  caregiver why so much formality! But trust me she knew her job well! Upon meeting her in person with a prior notice. she checked all my grand mother's  Medical Reports.We chronicled our past experiences. Both Roshan Sir and Soumya Madam  spoke  to us and spent time with us alomst 2 hours. They are highly Professional in dealing and highly  Knowledgeable in the  elderly care.We  were told why current care system failing; what to expect with grand mom in coming days. How can be draw a  proper care arrangement etc. This was an eye opener. Both Roshan Sir and Soumya Madam suggested care home option as my grand mom needed 24/7 attention and one carer at home would not stretch 24 hrs. Also they told us how to institutionalized care is important for fall preventional and mood management; slow down the progression of illness  with the  professionalism and knowledge they had; we had no reason to disbelieve but to take the advise of Roshan Sir and  Soumya Madom. My grand mother  passesed  away early this month due to massive cardiac  arrest.When i look  back the journey  caring her, it was fabulous! all because of "advantage seniors". My grand mother was  always happy loved & cared the best way possible. she was  not drowsy; or not drugged from prevent her from being violent. Instead  she was kept engaged all the time by lovely staffs. She was feed, cleaned and kept with utmost hygiene. When ever we visited we saw her cheerful unlike at home she was grumpy when we back from work.I have seen advantage staff keeping ultimate patience with my grand mom when she threw her food and spit on the face of the caring staff yet they exhibit a warm smile and feed my grand mother  by telling stories and diverting her attention like we do to our toddler. Many a times  when we visit without information they would be the same.The advantage staffs are, Truely Angels in disguise. Had  my grand mom had a cardiac arrest. I feel she would  have crossed 100 with the kind of care she received. I am ever greatful to Soumya Nair and Roshan Jacob(who is an Encyclopedia of knowledge) for hand holding me in this part of my life journey; for  guiding me with the right advise and supporting taking care of my grand mom like their own.Special thanks to Shwetha, Milan and Nikhil for showing love on my grand mom God bless & All the very best to advantage.
