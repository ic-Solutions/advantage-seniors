    - What is Transitional Care?

    - Older adults who suffer from a variety of chronic conditions often need health care services in different care settings to meet their many needs.

    - Transitional care refers to the coordination and continuity of receiving appropriate health care during a movement from one healthcare setting to either another or to home.

    - After discharge from the hospital because of surgery or illness, you may not be quite ready to go home. To help bridge this gap, you may go to a short-term rehabilitation facility also known as a transitional care facility.

    - When you get discharged from the hospital following treatment of an acute condition, you may require ongoing care for a chronic medical condition, as well as assistance with your day-to-day routine.

    - The rehabilitation may necessitate special equipment or services. In these situations, a transitional care provides supportive care, and promotes safe and timely passage across care settings.

    - From the gender perspective, Ageing women make up a significant proportion of the world's population and their numbers are growing. Women outnumber men in older age groups and this imbalance increases with age. Worldwide, there are some 123 women for every 100 men aged 60 and over.

    - The fastest growing group among ageing women is the oldest-old (age 80-plus).

    - Worldwide, by age 80 and over, there are 189 women for every 100 men. By age 100 and over, the gap reaches 385 women for every 100 men.

    - In general most ageing women remain relatively healthy and independent until late in life, the very old most often require chronic care and help with day-to-day activities.

    - Every woman must confront the fact that she may have a much longer life than she expected to have. Women simply don’t believe they will live to at least age 85. But there are many issues women need to deal with as they age.

    - The failure to plan for the future has left many older women in greatly reduced financial circumstances, and some have become homeless or forced to move in with relatives and perceived as “burden”.

    - We as social gerontology consultants sum up few such scenarios.

    - “…More women live longer and they are much more likely to be alone.” “Of women 65 and over, eight out of 10 depend on their for virtually all of their income.”

    - “Women are much more likely to be alone in old age [than men], and elderly women are more likely to be poor.”

    - “30 percent of the residual life expectancy at age 65 for women were spent in a state of chronic disability.”

    - “Old women are more subjected to neglect and abuse.”

    - “Inflation affects people who live longer more than those who live a shorter period so overall it is a greater issue for women. Its impact grows over time.”

    - These findings from our exposure to ‘many failing scenarios’ indicate that all women over 40 need to be thinking about the next 40 years of their lives, and yes, they probably will live that long or even more!

- title: Fall Prevention
  tag: "edition #3"

  description: Falls are all too common in the geriatric population, and they have devastating consequences.
  content:
    - Falls are all too common in the geriatric population, and they have devastating consequences. Most elders overlook the fact that ‘falls put them at risk of serious injury’. Fall prevention in the elderly is very important but unfortunately may not seem like a priority.

    - As we get older, physical changes and health conditions — and the medications used to treat those conditions — make falls more likely. In fact, falls are a leading cause of injury among older adults.

    - A person who falls may subsequently experience pain, hospitalisation, surgical intervention, admission to a nursing home, decreased overall functional ability, poorer quality of life, or constant fear of falling. It doesn’t mean you have to live in constant fear of falling, but we suggest to have precautions.

    - Here we suggest few simple fall-prevention strategies.

    - "<ol><li>Older adults may suffer from one or more chronic medical conditions. While it’s not the only contributor to falls, your medical condition is obviously a potential factor. If you or your loved one suffers from any medical condition, ask your doctor if this condition could increase the risk of a fall.</li><li>Make a list of the prescription and over-the-counter medications and supplements, and tell your doctor about this. Your doctor can review these medications for side effects and interactions that may increase your risk of falling. To help with fall prevention, the doctor may consider weaning you off from some medications that make you tired or affect your thinking, such as sedatives and some types of antidepressants.</li><li>If you avoid physical activity because you're afraid it will make a fall more likely. Physical activity is very important and it can go a long way toward fall prevention. With your doctor's approval, consider activities such as walking, water workouts or yoga — or a gentle exercise that involves slow and graceful dance-like movements. Such activities reduce the risk of falls by improving strength, balance, coordination and flexibility.</li><li>As part of your fall-prevention plan, consider changing your footwear. High heels, floppy slippers and shoes with slick soles can make you slip, stumble and fall. Instead, wear properly fitting, sturdy shoes with nonskid soles and better to have back straps. Sensible shoes may also reduce joint pain.</li><li>It is possible that the home environment may create falling hazards. A cluttered home, or one that otherwise puts obstacles in your way, can cause a fall even if your health and physical condition don’t predispose you to one. In addition, temporary variations in the home environment like water or oil in the floor, can create problems even if the home is normally without risks.</li></ol>"

    - Considering the devastating effects of falls have on patients and the increased burden on family members and the health care system, screening and assessment for fall risk have to be of paramount priorities.

    - We suggest periodic screening which may be easily performed in the ambulatory and hospital settings, with simple interventions producing meaningful results.

    - With each fall that is prevented, the old person, their family members, the health care team, and the health care system all benefit. By adopting a little planning and by taking concrete steps, this threat can be reduced or eliminated, giving the elderly person many years of independent living

    - Memory care units are typically architecturally designed to meet the specific needs of Alzheimer’s. This is to keep the stress of those with dementia at a minimum.

    - Some assisted living facilities do have secure areas to accommodate those with mild dementia, memory care units put an extra emphasis on security to prevent patients from wandering, which is common in those with more advanced dementia.

    - In dementia care facilities, staffs are trained to assist patients with their activities of daily living, such as helping an individual to bathe and offering help with changing clothes.

    - In specialised units like memory care units, staff is also trained to assist with activities of daily living, as well as trained to handle the specific needs of those with Alzheimer’s and other dementias.

    - The training includes understanding how the disease manifests, knowing why dementia patients may exhibit disruptive behavior, how to respond to it, and how to communicate with individuals with dementia.

    - Exercise and physical activity are good for just about everyone, including older adults. Again the intensity and the type of exercise depend on age and the physical condition.

    - Many elders seem to overdo and then end up in negative results.

    - Moderate physical activities are recommended for the aged with sufficient interval.

    - There are four main types and each type is different. Doing them all will give you more benefits.

    - Endurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, and biking are examples.

    - Strength exercises make your muscles stronger. Lifting weights or using a resistance band can build strength.

    - Balance exercises help prevent falls.

    - Flexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber.

    - If you have not been active, you can start slowly and work up to your goal. How much exercise you need depends on your age and health. Check with your health care provider on what is right for you.

    - Polypharmacy (ie, the use of multiple medications and/or the administration of more medications than are clinically indicated, representing unnecessary drug use) is common among the elderly.

    - Managing medications in the elderly can be complicated by the physiologic effects of aging and the prevalence of co-morbidities.

    - Consistent use of tools such as the Beers criteria and the STOPP/START criteria, as well as medication reconciliation, can reduce polypharmacy and its adverse drug effects, improving health outcomes in this population.

  content:
    - Caring for an elderly, ailing spouse is an unimaginably difficult task, especially when the caregivers are elderly themselves. Many studies have found to have established that wives fare worse, physically and emotionally, than husbands.

    - Women tend to marry men older than themselves, and men generally have more health problems and shorter lives. So it’s typically the woman taking care of the man.

    - In our social gerontology practice past 18 years, we have been able to follow hundreds of spousal pairs in which one cared for the other until he or she died, we have a fuller picture — and it’s not happy news for women.

    - Currently millions of people across the country provide free caregiving services for a chronically ill, disabled or aged spouse, family member or friend during any given year.

    - There is a much higher likelihood of receiving care from a spouse than from an adult child because in majority of instances, children live separately. In reality, approximately one quarter or above (27percent, from our study of 800 sample) of caregivers who are currently caring for a spouse are themselves over the age of 65.

    - Spouses are often not the best direct caregivers and this the point I want to highlight. The main advice I have for people who run into this problem is to roll with it. And seek outside help.

    - In the changed social scenario, Isolation and loneliness are serious problems for older adults. Loneliness is widespread and contagious. It is an epidemic.

    - Over a period of time older adults become less mobile, their friends and relatives die, hearing loss and other physical limitations make it harder to communicate with others, moreover seniors often reluctant to even try to make new friends.

    - As more of us insist on remaining in the community as we age, building social networks—whether digital or personal—will be increasingly important.

    - This is especially true for Baby Boomers, who have few children, and whose families often live in different cities than they do. As we age, communities are more important than ever. We must learn more about how to successfully build them.

    - Loneliness is a major issue that depletes the quality of life in old age. Shrinking social life, work life, spouse loss, children moving out or migrating to faraway places are seen as the major factors that affect older adults which eventually causes them to slip into loneliness.

    - As per the study conducted by Brigham Young University to learn about the top reason that increased longevity in humans, the evidence was unusually shocking it is not whether the person smoked or consumed alcohol or exercised or lead a leisurely life.
    - The study results showed that the people who had active social integration lived longer and showed highest healthy longevity. People who lived an active social life had the highest chances of a long life instead of the one who was alone,who was observed to not have a healthy life.

    - Tips to beat loneliness in old age
    - 1. Engage in social activities which interests along with your friends and known groups
    - 2. Visit to gatherings
    - 3. Social integration with neighbors
    - 4. Encouraging younger friends or known people to call in on you and participate in a common hobby that can be enjoyed together.
    - 5. Finding a post retirement hobby/ engagement
    - 6. Integrating children or grandchildren into life as much as they can get involved.
    - 7. Try not to prevent or restrict being social or creating new friends.

    - Spouse loss can be a traumatizing experience at any age. Death of a spouse can cause tremendous mental emotional stress clubbed with psychological impacts such as depression, loneliness and agony which can lead to physical consequences such as sleeplessness, lack of appetite.

    - In Most cases when an older adult loses his/her spouse the grief is evident in their daily life, they lose interest in their own care, lose interest in social integration, poor nutrition and it eventually effects their immunity making them more prone to serious morbidities.

    - Researches have shown that the risk of elderly person dying within the three months of their spouse is double in old age this phenomenon is often referred as “Broken Heart Syndrome”.

    - Elderly who suffered spouse loss needs a close monitoring and assistance to ensure the surviving spouse does not slip into fatalities due to extreme grief.

    - Families play an important role here in order to check if their elderly beloved one suffering death of their spouse is slipped into psychological issues, whereas communities with less filial support systems can make sure their elderly population suffering with spouse loss can be extended societal support systems to ensure they stay healthy.

    - In India scenarios families and children need to pay a special attention to ensure they are made felt wanted and loved. Immediate families or children of the surviving parent who is suffering with spouse loss can ensure they do not slip into depression or develop any other psychological impacts. Social and filial support systems helps them combat loneliness.

    - Families ensuring the support systems made available to ensure all the resources are provided to them when needed, is also paramount in assisting a parent suffering spouse loss.

    - Helping them increase their social interactions, Helping the socially integrate by arranging the right milieu and resources can have a progressive development in bring a parent out from post spouse loss emotional distress.

    - Roping in organizations working for elderly may have specialized care or programs to ensure the elderly suffering with spouseless can participate and overcome the bereavement.

    - This kind of progressive measure to seek professional help has to be view with positive outlook than stigmatic outlook as most families are novice and managing their beloved on in pain as much as they are may be challenging.

    - Ideally it is believed that when you are old and free and have more time at hand- you have a bigger social circle and friends, but in an ironic twist, as we age social circle tends to shrink.

    - Conventionally this scenario is thought to be due to our own awareness of our limited future time, or once we retire, we tend to think it’s doing away with the socialization.

    - In most conservative societies, retiring is akin to retiring from social life. Surprisingly advancement of research and finding helped us break our stigma against it.

    - A study conducted by Brigham Young University to find out what makes humans live up to 100 years and beyond gave results that were unassuming and myth-breaking. The study proved that, the top reason for staying healthy longer was “social Integration”.

    - People who were willing to integrate socially in later lives lived longer than those that did not.

    - No matter how old you are or how your health may be declining, social engagements are important. Social integration in later life has multi fold benefits in terms of health and emotional wellbeing.

    - Ageing comes with varied role changes, ending working with retirement, taking up the role of grand parenting, looking for help from children and immediate families those who, perhaps were once your dependents.

    - There may be varied key reasons that might stop older adults from being socially active such as diminished faculties, mobility difficulties, lack of resources to access places, financial constraints to entertain guests, or simply bound by the post retirement filial responsibilities.

    - Whatever be the reason, being socially engaged promotes sound mental health.

    - Driving at any age gives mobility and independence, in old age we continue to maintain independence by maintaining normal activities that we are used to doing from our younger days.

    - However diminishing faculties, cognitive abilities and in some cases declined intellectual abilities makes it dangerous to drive during advanced old age.

    - Troubled eyesight, troubled hearing, longer attention-reaction time and losing focus can be detrimental in keeping the safety of oneself and others on the road.

    - Mostly when elderly people are restricted to getting behind the wheels, there can be an acceptance issue, it may amount to restricting their mobility and freedom, considering them as too old and infirm, making them dependent etc. 

    - Many third world countries lack restrictions by law on driving in advanced old age. One can continue to drive without any health check after certain age even with diminished faculties. To keep the safety of oneself and others on the road, self-realization and admitting to the problems that makes driving more challenging would be of great help.

    - To help decide if one is fit enough to keep safety behind the wheels, ask yourself 

    - 1. Do I have to face honking by other drivers often when I drive?

    - 2. In the last one year how many accidents have I made, even though it may be a minor rubbing off?

    - 3. Do I get confused with the roads? Do I lose my way? 
    
    - 4. Do I not see things clearer until I come close to them?
    
    - 5. Do I lose interest in driving because I cause traffic snarls? 
    
    - 6. Do I jump traffic signals without noticing the stop signals?
    
    - 7. Do I get complaints regarding my parking?
    
    - 8. Do I forget to lock my car? 
    
    - 9. Do I have a problem in finding my way home? 
    
    - 10. Am I ticketed by traffic police often?
    
    - In the above 10 questions if your answer to more than 5 questions are YES then it is time to re-consider being behind the wheels alone. Perhaps it’s the right time for you to get a health check before you think of driving.

    - Socialization is key to robust mental health and switching over costs often diminishes the mental health of elderly people.

    - Urban living, changed social setting, changed filial structures have made it possible for elderly to get used to the changes whether it be living arrangements or adjusting to new social integrations.

    - In most cases, switching over costs are huge and it declines the social structure of the elderly and that adversely affects the mental and physical health of elderly people.

    - Adjusting to a new scenario and making a social circle often leaves the elderly behind lonely and isolated. When children migrate to urban cities in search of greener pastures, they leave behind their older parents in their hometown.

    - When children see that their parents health requires a lot of monitoring and they need more filial support, and it may be challenging for children to leave behind work and make frequent trips to visit parents, then they moot the idea of uprooting elderly parents into their urban homes.

    - This often results in many conveniences but elderly people have to trade their robust social life to the safety of living with filial support. This scenario causes tremendous stress on the mental health of older adults. 

    - Often adult children are at a loss finding what has happened to their elderly parents who suddenly become aloof and less interactive in their new houses.  Age old friends, neighbors, surrounding support systems that they had created, religious needs, and other social needs of the elderly are met when they live in a familiar, cordial surrounding, this must have taken ages to create and one will be found content in the same.

    - Uprooting elderly may restrict elderly of their physical mobility as they find the new geographic area unfamiliar and unfriendly. Lack of friends or not wanting to make new friends when they are moved to a different social set up which they are not used to (for example elderly moving from rural areas to metro cities) may be due to language issues and cultural differences which makes the elderly self-restrained of making new friends or interacting with new acquaintances.

    - These parameters play a major role in shrinking socialization, eventually it will affect the mental health and physical health of the elderly person. 
    
    - In Brigham Young University a study was conducted to see what made humans live up to 100 years and beyond, the results were not only shocking but also eye opening.
    
    - The conventional understanding of longevity is directly proportional to whether the person smoked or drank, the genetic predisposition of the individual, the exercise he did or the healthy lifestyle he followed. However the study revealed that people who lived to 100 years and beyond lived because they had “exceptionally good social integration”.
    
    - As long as we can promote social integration to elderly they will be happy mentally and physically healthy.

    - Nutrition is directly proportional to good health. Nutrition in women, children and sportsmen, celebrities for various fitness needs are much stressed aspect.

    - However when it comes to nutrition in elderly it has very less importance as there is no significant changes noticed. Nutritional needs of elderly are one of the most important aspects as their other care needs.

    - Majority of older adults are malnourished not necessarily because of poverty. Many urban, financially sound elderly who can afford good food fall under malnourishment due to undereating, eating disorders, physical inability to swallow, wrong choices of food, lack of support systems, and stubbornness about choices of food, etc. Also, many of the elderly who are on multiple medications suffer with contra indications due to medicine to food interactions.

    - A close monitoring for intake of nutrition is paramount for the elderly to keep them in the pink of health.

    - Evaluating the physical changes, like weight loss, droopy dry skin, change in skin color, fatigue, any other changes should be noted and see if it is directly associated to nutrition, one can seek any professional help for the same.

    - Physical disability affecting the intake can also be considered seriously. Not being able to pick up food can tamper with adequate intakes. Lack of appetite or mood swings, onset of mental health conditions can also take a toll on nutrition intake which needs close monitoring.

    - Degenerative neurological conditions such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease can also adversely affect nutritional intake. Patients with these conditions lose immediate history and tend to forget that they had food, which may result in  overeating or hallucinating that they already had, feeling of fullness may encourage patients to abstain from eating this can also lead to lack of nutrition.

    - Change in eating habits whether it is quantity or selection of food has to be closely monitored in elderly to ensure seniors get the right nutrition and their health is kept intact.

  content:
    - Sibling rivalry among your children can be a grave issue when you get older. It may sound like a petty toddler prank when your children are growing up but its not the same with the adult children.

    - The intensity and reason for the rivalry among your children can be sharp and serious as they get older and it can affect your retirement years and further care during infirm years as well.

    - Reason may be varied for triggering rivalry between the siblings, but when it comes to sharing the responsibility for the care of elderly parents, a difference of opinion can work against the best interest of the elderly parent unless the elderly parent makes his/her views clear on the care during infirm years.

    - Most rifts between children on the matter of caring for the elderly parents are associated with sharing financial responsibilities, accommodating an infirm parent and care-giving responsibilities.

    - An elderly parent’s need for emotional support is mostly left unnoticed. The best way to ward off the dangers associated with sibling rivalry among your children is to plan your retirement and infirm years.

    - Planning estate, wealth and money can also be helpful in safe guarding your retirement against difference of opinion among children. Seeing children as your sole dependable source of support during infirm years rather than making definite plans can be detrimental.

    - Instead have a definite plan and walk the children through it, making each of them clear about what they are expected of or what they can expect from aged parents can narrow down uncertainties to a major extent.
