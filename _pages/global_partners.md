<h2>advantAGE Global Partner Program</h2>

<p>
  The world is so expansive, and we are so distanced from other parts of the
  earth, that another continent can sometimes feel like another planet.
  Everything in this planet differ from place to place, country to country and
  continent to continent, in short, there’s difference in ideologies, religions,
  cultures, customs, and languages. Different foods, faces, and climates.
</p>

<p>
  No matter where we are, despite the distance and the differing ways we live,
  there is one need that is constant in all parts of the world – the need for
  quality elder care. That’s why advantAGE seniors is trying to cobble up
  collaborations worldwide with the leaders in the aged care across the globe in
  order to promote aging studies and development in the long term care. The
  program is called Global Partners in Care (GPC).
</p>

<p>
  Global Partners in Care operates with the mission to create worldwide
  partnerships that enhance global compassionate care, and improve access to
  hospice and palliative care for all nations. This program enables us to
  support similar organizations in enhancing their knowledge base in aged care.
  The goal is for partners to engage in capacity-building, strategic planning,
  education, fundraising, and technical assistance to improve services for those
  in need.
</p>

<p>
  Like minded long term care providers across the world are invited to join
  hands with us in our global partners in care program. Let’s make the world a
  better place for elders to approach the fag end of their life with dignity,
  care and hope.
