                            <p>We just concluded a year long study, titled "The young generation's perception on the
                                elderly and on the services for the elderly in Mangalore". This was a joint study with
                                School of Social work, Roshninilya, Mangalore. Right now we are in the process of
                                initiating three more studies. All three can be initiated through joint studies with an
                                educational institutions of good repute who are equally concerned about the ever
                                increasing aging population. Three topics shortlisted for studies are as follows. The
                                first one is to understand the standards of care presently followed in long term care
                                settings. Presently a pilot study is already initiated.</p>

                            <p>Second proposed study is to find the Ageism's influence on nursing practice. Ultimate aim
                                is to find the nurse's knowledge, willingness and future intentions to work with older
                                adults. The third one is to understand the absenteeism and work to family conflict among
                                the employed informal caregivers. Family support and caregiving beyond a period is
                                impossible and the struggle at providing care for a long term care patient is severe and
                                excruciating. Employers also suffer as very often the employee takes off from work
                                citing the filial obligations. The study's aim is to understand how many of such
                                employees are directly providing care to the long term care to the relative and what's
                                their challenge.</p>

                            <p>
                                Social gerontology is a multidisciplinary field focused on the social aspects of aging.
                                Unfortunately, in India, none of the universities have social gerontology as a
                                discipline and we ignore the subject because our population is young and we gloss over
                                impending crisis. 14 years as practicing social gerontologists, we felt the need for
                                more studies in our community as our issues are very unique and findings are the basis
                                for future policy making. Another strength of advantAGE is its emphasis on applied
                                research.</p>

                            <p>advantAGE seniors is a stimulating work environment which provides opportunities to
                                closely collaborate with practitioner-researchers, institutional researchers, a
                                librarian and knowledge transfer experts from US and other European countries. These
                                individuals actively participate in our research projects, bringing unique perspectives
                                and unparalleled enthusiasm, and also play a key role in training the next generation of
                                researchers in social gerontology.</p>
