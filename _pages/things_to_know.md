						<div class="bgtext">

							<p>
								In todays world, it is common for extended families and friends to be separated by great
								distance. New job opportunities force the adult children of families to move away from
								home. Often parents are left alone in Bangalore. However, at some point in their lives,
								your parents, grandparents or a loved one will become unable to properly care for
								themselves. Suddenly, you are faced with the challenges of long distance caregiving. We
								manage plenty of such situations and make life easier for children who are worried about
								the parent's health and welfare.</p>

							<p>You may be wondering how the systems function. when you feel your mother or father needs
								round the clock nursing care or just companionship you can call us in any of our phone
								numbers or e-mail us. We will ask you to send your immediate relative or friend or
								cousin or a neighbor to the office to have a preliminary discussion and evaluation. Then
								we'll send our Nurse manager and Geriatric are manager to your house to take stock of
								things as well as to know the patient. Once we finish the home visit we, will write back
								to you about or care plan and how we are going to do this.</p>

							<p>Remember, sitting in a far off place, you are at a disadvantage of galvanizing all the
								supports from various sources. unless it is a one stop shop for your needs, lot of
								inconveniences like time, money, and running around happens. You also cannot bother your
								cousin or neighbor much as they have their own schedules. To ease the burden, you
								definitely need a good service provider who has credibility, competence and
								professionalism. Before you hire a service provider, please evaluate the credibility of
								the organization and not who offer moon and who fail later.</p>

							<p>You should find out how the service provider imparts training, what is the protocol
								regarding the replacements, how the grievance redressal system function etc,. Moreover
								emergency response systems, ability to manage when the condition changes to a different
								level and availability of assisted living facility also matters when you choose a
								provider. Sitting in a far off place you should be able to access all these if required.
							</p>

							<p>We monitor the patient as often as possible through personal visits and through phone. On
								emergency situations we are at a phone call away. You can retain us as your proxy. We
								charge separately for this type of service.</p>

							<p>Ask anyone in Bangalore, your contacts, you'll get our name as a competent, trustworthy,
								passionate service provider in long term care. Over the years we created a tradition in
								caring the distressed and the disabled. Caring is our passion.</p>

							<p>It can often be hard to tell when aging is affecting a family member. It is possible that
								a 90 year old man to be in perfect health and very functional. He can be socially active
								and agile too. But this may not be the case with many elders. Many of them may be
								chronically ill and chronic situation increases as the age advances.</p>

							<p>As a family member, one must be vigilant and observant for warning signs in an elderly
								person. Many a time, as elderly person will avoid opening up or reluctant to discuss the
								problems with the youngsters. Don’t ignore the warning signs, because small things can
								add up to a larger challenge incredibly fast. If you observe certain changes in your
								loved one, it might be the time to seek personal help. Look for these signs:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Changes in relationships with family and friends</li>
								<li>Withdrawal from social interactions</li>
								<li>Neglecting personal care such as hygiene or nutrition</li>
								<li>Signs of forgetfulness</li>
								<li>Mismanagement of finances such as unpaid bills or unsound purchases</li>
								<li>speaking loudly or little talking at all</li>
							</ul>

						<div class="thingspagehd"><a name="3">Questions to Ask When Hiring a Service Provider</a></div>
						<div class="bgtext">

							<p>If you decide on home care there are several questions you should ask to ensure that your
								loved one will stay safe, healthy and happy. Seeking professional help in elderly care
								is relatively new to our country. Earlier there were joint families and the family
								members take turns to tend to the needs of the elderly and the bedridden. Now the
								society structure and function changed to a more westernized culture and there is no
								more family care giver.</p>

							<p>This resulted in mushrooming of the agencies that provide “aides, cooks, drivers and
								“caregivers”. Very few run professionally. Many are fly-by-night operators who cheat the
								gullible clients. Beware of these agencies who will dupe you and in turn your loved
								one’s health can be in peril. So we caution you while hiring a service provider.</p>

							<ol>
								<li>What is the legal entity of the organization?</li>
								<li>What is the qualification of the proprietors or people who run it?</li>
								<li>Are they well experienced in the long term care?</li>
								<li>What is their hiring policy?</li>
								<li>What is the organizational set up?</li>
								<li>What type of the training is imparted to the care giver?</li>
								<li>Are the care givers sensitized and tuned for “elderly care”?</li>
								<li>Is there any CME conducted for the care giver, if so, how often?</li>
								<li>What happens if the care giver is ill or unavailable for few days? What is the
									alternate arrangement?</li>
								<li>Is there any prescribed leave rules?</li>
								<li>How will the service provider monitor the care giver?</li>
								<li>What is the complaint redressel mechanism?</li>
								<li>What is the refund policy?</li>
								<li>What are the facilities to be provided to the care giver viz food, accommodation
									etc.? </li>
							</ol>

						<div class="thingspagehd"><a name="4">Take Care of Yourself</a></div>
						<div class="bgtext">

							As a person begins to age, family members are often called on to help with everyday things
							that their loved one now finds challenging – meal preparation, laundry and housekeeping.
							Eventually, many people find themselves assisting their loved ones in ways they never
							expected – like hygiene and grooming – or for diseases and disorders they could never have
							anticipated.
							<p>Providing care for an elderly parent can be deeply rewarding. It can also be emotionally
								stressful, physically exhausting and financially draining. Studies consistently show
								that people who provide care to loved ones suffer from higher levels of depression than
								their non-caregiving peers. In fact, some studies show that as many as half of adult
								caregivers show signs of depression.</p>

							<p>When you're faced with providing care for a loved one, do not set aside your own needs.
								You are the most important person in the process. If you allow yourself to "burn out",
								you can no longer care for your loved one and may find that it's hard to take care of
								yourself.</p>

							To avoid the high levels of stress associated with caregiving:
							<ul>
								<li>Monitor your health. Inadequate sleep and high levels of stress can easily take a
									physical toll. If you find yourself physically or mentally weaker, schedule an
									appointment with your doctor.</li>
								<li>Set aside a few hours a week of down time outside of the home, maybe lunch with
									friends or an afternoon at the park.</li>
								<li>Stay connected to others. Do not allow yourself to become isolated from friends or
									other family members.</li>
								<li>See a counselor to discuss the effects of your newfound role as caregiver.</li>
							</ul>

						<div class="thingspagehd"><a name="5">Why Not You Discuss Things With Your Parents ?</a></div>
						<div class="bgtext">

							Remember, as you were growing up, your parents probably sat you down plenty of times for “a
							talk.” Is it time to reverse the process? Yes, you wanted to discuss many things but you
							shied away not knowing how to broach the subject.

							<p>A heart to heart talk about some vital issues with loved ones who are growing older can
								be a challenge. Due to the complexity and sensitivity many dodge the elder care planning
								or they give minimum attention. Our experience show that few Indians have these
								conversations until a major event occurs—a sudden health crisis, the loss of a spouse,
								or even a holiday visit by children during which it becomes apparent that Mom or Dad is
								having some issues with the activities of daily living.</p>

							<p>No point waiting until a crisis moment isn’t a good planning strategy. Instead, you need
								to discuss these subjects before a crisis arises. To avoid rejection, better to keep it
								casual, don’t overwhelm Mom and Dad, let them feel your love and concern. And remember:
								helping your parents plan is not only important for their well-being as they age, but
								will make a difference in your own financial, emotional and physical health as well.
								Above all, you will be at peace.</p>

							<p><strong>Here is a list of issues to think about and discuss:</strong></p>



							<p><strong>Living options</strong> - it feasible for your parents to stay in their current
								home as long as possible? Or are they considering “downsizing” or moving to a senior
								living community? Discuss what they would prefer if they were to experience a decline in
								health and need greater assistance with the activities of daily living. Home care?
								Assisted living?</p>

							<p><strong>Home modifications </strong> - Certainly as the age advances your parents may
								have some physical difficulty which warrents some physicl modifications in the house. Is
								your parents’ home keeping up with their needs? What repairs and modifications could
								make their house, apartment or condominium safer and more convenient?</p>

							<p><strong>Physical activities</strong> - after study shows that regular physical activity
								is the most important contributor to healthy aging. No matter what a person’s condition,
								adding exercise is of benefit. Encourage your loved ones to add more exercise to their
								lifestyle.</p>

							<p><strong>Social activities</strong> - social interaction is vital to the physical,
								emotional and intellectual health of people of every age. For seniors, spending time
								with children is richly rewarding—but did you know that recent studies show that seniors
								who socialize not only with family members but also with other groups have better
								emotional, intellectual and physical health?</p>

							<p><strong>Estate planning</strong> - your parents have an up-to-date will? If their plan is
								to pass property to family members, have they talked to a financial advisor about the
								best way to do that? How can their assets help provide for their own care in case of a
								decline in health or incapacity?</p>

							<p><strong>Advance healthcare planning</strong> - your parents completed advance directives
								for healthcare, including a healthcare power of attorney and living will? These are some
								formalities in US and Europe which we don't follow. But you can discusswith them what
								their wishes are if they were to be incapacitated and unable to make their own
								healthcare decisions?</p>

							<p><strong>Fall prevention</strong> - if they have already experienced falls, many older
								adults are reluctant to discuss this topic. But did you know that fall protection is
								actually an important part of planning for the future? Falls are one of the leading
								causes of incapacity…and this is one risk factor for incapacity that we can take
								proactive steps to avoid.</p>

							<p><strong>Avoiding crime and fraud</strong> - , criminals and con artists often target
								vulnerable seniors. Scams and unethical sales methods aimed at older people can cause
								serious financial loss. Seniors who have been victimized are often ashamed to discuss
								the incident. So bring up the subject and educate yourself and your parents about
								crooked sweepstakes, identity theft and unscrupulous salespersons.</p>

							<p>These topic suggestions are intended to provide a framework for seniors and family
								members as they talk and plan together. And if a direct discussion isn’t working as well
								as you’d like, consider adding outside new members to the team! Your loved one’s
								healthcare provider can be a doctor, a geriatric care manager which is yet a new breed
								in our society, financial planner or his/her best friend can all provide valuable help
								and guidance.Remember that you share a common goal in this planning: that you and your
								loved ones are able to live life as fully and joyfully as possible.</p>

							<p><strong>Many Options Many Answers</strong></p>

							<p>“When we walk in the door to meet each family, we understand that we are facing a
								lifetime of personal history coming together in a moment of crisis. Perhaps mom has
								fallen and wants to be home, but the bathroom is on another floor and that just can’t
								happen. Perhaps the children all live out of country and there are only so many options
								for dad, who is no longer able to live alone but is resistant to the idea of getting
								help. We listen with an open agenda and, drawing on our broad resources, help each
								family make the very best decisions for the patient.” – Soumya Laxmi.</p>

							<p>Indian families have undergone a big sea change in its functioning, coherence and
								structure. Demographic shift towards more and more octogenarians and the consequence of
								them being chronically ill can have a bearing on the family members especially on
								children.</p>

							<p>Limitations like strained relationship, distance, time, lack of skill, finance
								constraints, sibling rivalry, women in workforce makes the caregiving of a long term
								care patient more complex and solutions seems to be insurmountable. None of the
								hospitals and the treating doctors have considered the continuum of care which extends
								to the house is their concern. Once discharged, the relationship mostly ends with a
								discharge summary. It is not their concern how the family is going to manage the patient
								or how the rehabilitation is going to happen. A lack of guidance and proper information
								makes matters worse. </p>

							<p>Many a time people come to us trammelled and perplexed due to insufficient information
								and a definitive long term care plan.We believe that it is not that disease alone that
								has to be tackled when it comes to long term care. It is more complex and taxing than
								one thinks. You have come to the right people who have the right qualifications and
								immense experience in the field of geriatrics and social gerontology.</p>

							<p>Although older adults have many strengths that may be called upon in times of need, some
								problems and losses may require outside help. For some people, painful events in the
								past, dissatisfaction in the present, or worries about the future may mean that they
								cannot enjoy life or achieve their goals. Adult children or others who are concerned
								about an older adult can also benefit from counseling services.</p>

							People who could benefit from counseling may be:
							<ul>
								<li>Feeling depressed</li>
								<li>Adjusting to illness</li>
								<li>Experiencing stress in their families or social situation</li>
								<li>Having marital problems</li>
								<li>Grieving</li>
								<li>Concerned about or providing care for an older adults</li>
							</ul>
