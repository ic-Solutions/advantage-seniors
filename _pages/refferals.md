  <strong>Why Refer advantAGE Home Care?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The world of health care is changing. The medical community is collaborating
  with many stakeholders in ways never seen before. advantAGE is a part of that
  collaboration. We provide communication, education and health care for your
  patients with post-acute care and chronic disease management needs. We are a
  partner in the continuum of care for hospitals and for physicians.
</p>

<p>
  Post-acute care is an increasingly important aspect of the care continuum for
  physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Establishing a home
  health care relationship to extend professional health care services into
  patients’ homes is a key strategy to improve patient satisfaction and
  outcomes, and reduce preventable readmissions. Whether you are a Physician or
  Consultant Doctor, Senior Nurse, Medico- Social Worker, Care Manager,
  Physiotherapist, we have made the referral process very easy for you. Simply
  phone or email us your clients details (name, phone number, e-mail address).
  We will quickly make initial contact and send in a team of social gerontology
  professionals to assess the level of care required. All three imperative team
  members arrive together to take assessments: Senior Nurse, Social
  gerontologist, and our Company Representative. Everything is taken care of in
  one visit, which saves valuable time and reduces stress.
</p>

<p>
  Our team of professionals headed by a social gerontologist can offer creative
  solutions, such as caregiver arrangements based on a detailed care plan that
  will enable your clients to be in a better position to afford the services
  that they need. We would be glad to discuss different options with your
  clients, should the need arise, regarding making the services more affordable.
  Our rates are extremely competitive and our service is the best in the city.
  Leaving the fine details to us ensures that your client is in the very best
  hands—receiving superior quality care with the utmost concern for their
  safety, dignity and quality of life.
</p>

<p>
  As a pioneer and leader in the home health care industry with international
  collaborations, advantAGE has long championed the value of providing patients
  with a continuum of care. We’ve invested in the clinical services,
  infrastructure and expertise necessary to deliver quality health care services
