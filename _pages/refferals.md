                                stakeholders in ways never seen before. advantAGE is a part of that collaboration. We
                                provide communication, education and health care for your patients with post-acute care

                            <p>Post-acute care is an increasingly important aspect of the care continuum for physicians,
                                hospitals and other health care providers. Establishing a home health care relationship
                                to extend professional health care services into patients’ homes is a key strategy to
                                improve patient satisfaction and outcomes, and reduce preventable readmissions. Whether
