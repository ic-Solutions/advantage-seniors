                            <p>
                                <strong>Sumitha</strong><br />
                                Nominated by Amith Bhargava</p>

                            <p>Sumitha has always been very dependable. She goes out of her way to provide for any need.
                                She is a stickler to high standards of personal hygiene. She is always on time and never
                                complains. She is always very professional and dresses very well for the job.</p>

                            <h3>OCTOBER-16</h3>

                                <strong>SARASA
                                </strong><br>
                                Nominated by Abraham Thomas</p>
                            <p>Sarasa is prompt, thorough, compassionate and makes my father feel good. Her caring
                                attitude for my father was life changing. My father is demanding and mostly adamant and
                                finicky, but Sarasa is always at his beck and call. Even when we feel my father is
                                difficult, she kind of negotiate between us and bring peace. She is very compassionate
                                and no one could doubt her ability to keep cool in a crisis. She is a peacemaker.
                            </p>

                                Nominated by Tara Viswanathan,
                            </p>

                            <p>Vijayalakshmi is an exceptionally great caregiver to my mother in law. She never calls
                                off and has excellent communication with my mom-in law who is hard of hearing.
                                Vijayalakshmi works very hard and we all love her. She is very pleasant and respectful
                                to be around and never has an unkind word for anyone. She is an asset to your
                                organization.</p>
