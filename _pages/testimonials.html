								<p><strong>Dear Mr. Jacob and Ms. Soumya Laxmi</strong></p>

								<p>I want to take the opportunity to thank you for meeting with me and Aparna recently.
									I want to place on record you valuable service in assisting Kevin Nixon during his
									days at your center. You and your staff certainly went above and beyond the call of
									duty in providing life support and comfort to Mr. Nixon.</p>

								<p>Please accept my thanks for the excellent service you extended to Mr. Nixon. I wish
									you good luck in your future plans in expanding your services.</p>

								<p>When my 98 year old grandfather was starting to not be able to manage himself at home
									though we had full time care giver, I started looking for a care facility that could
									look after him. I was flexible with cost but needed a place that will ensure my
									grandfather is taken good care of. I went through internet and collected about 40
									plus facility addresses and did visit about 10 of them but was deeply disappointed
									as they were not to the standards of hygiene and care I needed. The focus of these
									facilities was to provide care for people who cannot afford it and they were doing
									the best they could with in the limited means and were depending on donations etc.
								</p>

								<p>I needed a place that operated commercially with ability to offer better care and
									hygiene. Finally I visited Advantage seniors Foundation. Roshan and Soumya who run
									this place made me feel very comfortable. End of my first visit, I was impressed and
									felt that they knew about caring for terminally ill patients. Though I continued to
									be skeptical about this decision, I finally moved my grandfather to Advantage
									Seniors Foundation on June 21 st 2011.</p>

								<p>After few weeks I was certain that I found the correct place and was confident my
									grandfather is assured of the care he deserves. Almost a year passed by like a
									breeze and every time I visited my grandfather, I thanked god for having introduced
									me to this care facility. Around March 2012, my grand dad was 99 and was getting
									very ill and he finally passed away on April 20th 2012. Though it was late in the
									night, both Roshan and Soumya stood by me to ensure his body is appropriately packed
									and stored till funeral next morning.</p>
								<p>They walked me to my car and left the hospital after me. Let me tell you, everyone at
									this care facility are wonderful people with utmost sense of humanity,
									responsibility and professionalism. They were there through my granddadâ€™s care and
									death with the same sense of commitment they promised the day I went to visit them.
									I strongly recommend this care facility for your near and dear who needs terminal
									care.</p>

								<p>"Advantage Geriatric Care Facility is well maintained, clean, ventilated and above
									all located in a very good and accessible residential area. My mother is a patient
									of dementia, cerebral ataxia and incontinence and needs constant care for her basic
									needs and the caregivers at Advantage do a good job at it. My mother has been there
									for 2 years now. The visiting hours are very convenient and (occasional) special
									requests to extend or alter the timings are accommodated. I can trust the staff at
									Advantage to handle any emergency medical situations when I'm out of station
									traveling, on business or personal work."</p>
