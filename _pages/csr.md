                                <P>Having a nurse in active congregational ministry provides a unique forum for health
                                    promotion and disease prevention. Members of a faith community, knowing that a
                                    Nurse/Volunteer is available on an informal basis, can discuss a health concern with
                                    the nurse before it becomes a chronic or serious condition. Most often, parish
                                    nurses are connected to a congregation, serving in a variety of ways, promoting
                                    health for the whole person. Parish nurses act as health educators, personal health
                                    counselors, health advocates, referral agents, coordinators of volunteers and
                                    integrators of faith and wellness.</P>

                                <p>Nurses serving congregations is a relatively old concept being now revisited by many
                                    churches across the world. Several factors have pushed parish nursing to the
                                    forefront of church ministries and getting more relevance in the present society.
                                    Unwanted hospitalizations, longer than desired hospital stays, changing family
                                    structure, an aging population, rising health care costs and increasing numbers of
                                    chronic illnesses have had an impact on families and communities. In our country,
                                    many patients are ill advised for hospitalizations, and medical treatment. Where can
                                    a family receive more appropriate and authentic information and help? Through PHM,
                                    churches can intervene in this situation and have developed different ministries to
                                    help meet the health needs of their members as well as the community around the
                                    church.</p>

                                <p>advantAGE seniors consulting envisioned parish nursing as a partnership between
                                    healthcare systems and congregations, linking resources of the healthcare system to
                                    the faith community. We recognize the church as being a place that promote health
                                    and wholeness for centuries through worship, music, sharing, and caring. In
                                    addition, communities of faith are an institution that interacts with individuals
                                    from birth through death. So we feel the church is duty bound to initiate PHM in
                                    every church across the length and breadth of the country.</p>

                                <p>No doubt we have a habitual liking towards village work. We believe that real life
                                    exists in villages, though many disadvantages galore. We go to villages for two
                                    things. First, to identify the prospective caregivers and secondly, to create
                                    awareness about rural ageing. Undoubtedly, caregivers are the backbone of elder
                                    care. Given the hardship and intricacies of full time care giving, very few are
                                    willing to take up this job. Lives of many less educated, distressed rural women
                                    continue to exist in despair. We tell the gospel that there is hope in the form of a
                                    well-paid and well respected job as a caregiver.</p>

                                <p>We create livelihoods for the deprived and the underprivileged women and there by
                                    whole family is benefited. In short, we put back smile in many lives whose life
                                    tottered with hopelessness. We are able to script a win-win situation for the rural
                                    distressed women and at the same time getting care to the needy person.</p>

                                <p>Every caregiver who work with us comes from the rural background. They all have a
                                    common story of poverty, hardships, anguish, agony and sometime destitution. We hand
                                    hold them in their misery and teach them the care giving skills. This is a lifetime
                                    skill. Every story we scripted is mega success. Our rural interventions bear fruit
                                    when our care givers reclaim their life.</p>

                                <p>We established “ashraya seva samasthe” in Haveri district to create awareness about
                                    ageing as well as to look after the poor older adults. We are in the process of
                                    initiating talks with the government for further expansion to other areas.</p>

                                <p>Another initiative which is dear to advantAGE is “chinnara angala” which is again to
                                    support the single parent. Most of the young single parents are in a catch 22
                                    situation that they are in dilemma as who will look after the children when they go
                                    for work. This is where we want to have a hostel for the kids where we provide food
                                    accommodation, and education easing the troubles of single parenting and in turn the
                                    kids get good education.</p>
