<h2>Coma Care</h2>

<p>
  Years in the long term care industry, advantAGE seniors is concerned with the
  care of coma patients in our community. We believe and advocate that the
  comatose person also deserve the same care and attention as any other patient.
</p>

<p>
  Riddled with uncertainty, a coma is one of the most frightening injuries, at
  least in part because literally the life comes to a standstill for the
  comatose person as well as the family and friends. Loosing hope is nothing but
  natural in the long wait. But the good news is that people can and do survive
  comas. Over the last 15 years in long term care with a specialization in coma
  management, we felt a strong need to fortify and bolster the family and
  friends morale, thereby providing the best chances of a wake-up from deep
  sleep.
</p>

<p>
  After the initial shock, the family comes to the reality and stares at the
  fact, How Long? Yes it’s a long wait. Uncertainty looms large for the family
  and friends. Most of the families have no clue about caring protocol and are
  poorly informed of the nursing outcomes. Few of the family get sucked into the
  vortex of despair and no one coming forward to help and support. Majority of
  the family get unsolicited opinions from multiple sources thus the decision
  making becomes difficult.
</p>

<p>
  Majority of Comatose patients are on life sustaining interventions like
  Tracheostomy, Gastrostomy, Catheter and so on. Proper nutrition is essential
  to recovery, so evaluations can be performed to determine the best means for a
  patient to maintain adequate nutrition. The feeding tube will maintain proper
  nutrition until a patient is able to swallow properly again. Several feeding
  tubes are common: the nasogastric (NG) tube, which does not require a surgical
  procedure for use and is passed through the patient’s nose and into the
  stomach; the jejunostomy (J) tube, which is surgically inserted directly into
  the small intestine, and the gastrostomy (G) tube, which is inserted directly
  into the stomach.

  The long period of inactivity that may be part of the comatose condition can
  cause certain physical problems. Skin problems such as pressure ulcers can
  develop after lying in one position for a long time. The best prevention is
  frequent inspection of the skin and shifting and repositioning. Blood clots,
  called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), may develop especially in the legs when
  patients have limited mobility. In short prevention, maintenance and quality
  nursing care is what a comatose person needs for his ‘recovery’.
</p>

<p>
  In short, it’s round the clock care and attention needed for a comatose
  patient in the days to come. At this point, the family is utterly confused as
  how to cope with the demands of intense care. Once a person is medically
  stable, transfer to a long-term rehabilitation facility like our coma care
  facility. In our coma facility, he or she will spend several hours a day in a
  structured rehabilitation program. The goals of our coma rehabilitation
  includes minimizing morbidity, maintaining functional positioning, hygiene,
  nutrition, and medication management, as well as providing support for the
  person with a brain injury and his or her family. The family will be relieved
  of the stress once the comatose person is under our care. We provide the best
  possible care and assist the person in coma towards independence.
