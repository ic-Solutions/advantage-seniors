<h3>Testimonial 1</h3>
<p><strong>Dear Mr. Jacob and Ms. Soumya Lakshmi</strong></p>

<p>
  I want to take the opportunity to thank you for meeting with me and Aparna
  recently. I want to place on record you valuable service in assisting Kevin
  Nixon during his days at your center. You and your staff certainly went above
  and beyond the call of duty in providing life support and comfort to Mr.
  Nixon.
</p>

<p>
  Please accept my thanks for the excellent service you extended to Mr. Nixon. I
  wish you good luck in your future plans in expanding your services.
</p>

<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

<h3>Testimonial 2</h3>

<p>
  When my 98 year old grandfather was starting to not be able to manage himself
  at home though we had full time care giver, I started looking for a care
  facility that could look after him. I was flexible with cost but needed a
  place that will ensure my grandfather is taken good care of. I went through
  internet and collected about 40 plus facility addresses and did visit about 10
  of them but was deeply disappointed as they were not to the standards of
  hygiene and care I needed. The focus of these facilities was to provide care
  for people who cannot afford it and they were doing the best they could with
  in the limited means and were depending on donations etc.
</p>

<p>
  I needed a place that operated commercially with ability to offer better care
  and hygiene. Finally I visited Advantage seniors Foundation. Roshan and Soumya
  who run this place made me feel very comfortable. End of my first visit, I was
  impressed and felt that they knew about caring for terminally ill patients.
  Though I continued to be skeptical about this decision, I finally moved my
  grandfather to Advantage Seniors Foundation on June 21 st 2011.
</p>

<p>
  After few weeks I was certain that I found the correct place and was confident
  my grandfather is assured of the care he deserves. Almost a year passed by
  like a breeze and every time I visited my grandfather, I thanked god for
  having introduced me to this care facility. Around March 2012, my grand dad
  was 99 and was getting very ill and he finally passed away on April 20th 2012.
  Though it was late in the night, both Roshan and Soumya stood by me to ensure
  his body is appropriately packed and stored till funeral next morning.
</p>
<p>
  They walked me to my car and left the hospital after me. Let me tell you,
  everyone at this care facility are wonderful people with utmost sense of
  humanity, responsibility and professionalism. They were there through my
  granddadâ€™s care and death with the same sense of commitment they promised the
  day I went to visit them. I strongly recommend this care facility for your
  near and dear who needs terminal care.

  "Advantage Geriatric Care Facility is well maintained, clean, ventilated and
  above all located in a very good and accessible residential area. My mother is
  a patient of dementia, cerebral ataxia and incontinence and needs constant
  care for her basic needs and the caregivers at Advantage do a good job at it.
  My mother has been there for 2 years now. The visiting hours are very
  convenient and (occasional) special requests to extend or alter the timings
  are accommodated. I can trust the staff at Advantage to handle any emergency
  medical situations when I'm out of station traveling, on business or personal
  work."
