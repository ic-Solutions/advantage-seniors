Exercise and physical activity are good for just about everyone, including older adults. Again the intensity and the type of exercise depend on age and the physical condition.

Many elders seem to overdo and then end up in negative results.

Moderate physical activities are recommended for the aged with sufficient interval.

There are four main types and each type is different. Doing them all will give you more benefits.

Endurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, and biking are examples.

Strength exercises make your muscles stronger. Lifting weights or using a resistance band can build strength.

Balance exercises help prevent falls.

Flexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber.

If you have not been active, you can start slowly and work up to your goal. How much exercise you need depends on your age and health. Check with your health care provider on what is right for you.
