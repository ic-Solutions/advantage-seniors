  - Memory care units are typically architecturally designed to meet the specific needs of Alzheimer’s. This is to keep the stress of those with dementia at a minimum.

  - Some assisted living facilities do have secure areas to accommodate those with mild dementia, memory care units put an extra emphasis on security to prevent patients from wandering, which is common in those with more advanced dementia.

  - In dementia care facilities, staffs are trained to assist patients with their activities of daily living, such as helping an individual to bathe and offering help with changing clothes.

  - In specialised units like memory care units, staff is also trained to assist with activities of daily living, as well as trained to handle the specific needs of those with Alzheimer’s and other dementias.

  - The training includes understanding how the disease manifests, knowing why dementia patients may exhibit disruptive behavior, how to respond to it, and how to communicate with individuals with dementia.
