Polypharmacy (ie, the use of multiple medications and/or the administration of more medications than are clinically indicated, representing unnecessary drug use) is common among the elderly.

Managing medications in the elderly can be complicated by the physiologic effects of aging and the prevalence of co-morbidities.

Consistent use of tools such as the Beers criteria and the STOPP/START criteria, as well as medication reconciliation, can reduce polypharmacy and its adverse drug effects, improving health outcomes in this population.
