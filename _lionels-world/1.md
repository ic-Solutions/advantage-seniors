    - What is Transitional Care?

    - Older adults who suffer from a variety of chronic conditions often need health care services in different care settings to meet their many needs.

    - Transitional care refers to the coordination and continuity of receiving appropriate health care during a movement from one healthcare setting to either another or to home.

    - After discharge from the hospital because of surgery or illness, you may not be quite ready to go home. To help bridge this gap, you may go to a short-term rehabilitation facility also known as a transitional care facility.

    - When you get discharged from the hospital following treatment of an acute condition, you may require ongoing care for a chronic medical condition, as well as assistance with your day-to-day routine.

    - The rehabilitation may necessitate special equipment or services. In these situations, a transitional care provides supportive care, and promotes safe and timely passage across care settings.
