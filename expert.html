    </span></div>

    <p><img src="images/expert/PAUL_NASH.png" alt=""/>


<p>Paul is a chartered psychologist working as a research project manager in the Centre for Innovative Ageing at Swansea University. He has a developed a niche within social gerontology at Swansea, specializing in the psychological constructs of ageing and ageism.</p>

<p>Paul Graduated with an honours degree in Psychology from the University of Glamorgan where he was actively encouraged to continue into postgraduate education. From this point, Paul embarked on teaching research methodologies to undergraduate students whilst completing his MPhil degree. Following the completion of the Masters programme and acceptance onto the doctoral scheme, Paul joined the Office for National Statistics, a governmental body for generating national data, as a Senior Survey Methodologist. Here, Paul used his psychological underpinning whilst further increasing his knowledge of large level data sets.</p>

<p>Whilst embarking on his PhD in the field of social psychology, Paul chose to specialize in attitudes specifically regarding older people, the topic he has since carved a niche in. He secured a job running a research project at Swansea University where he quickly became an integral part of the Centre for Innovative Ageing. On the back of his first position at Swansea, Paul has acted as an advisor to both private and governmental bodies, imparting research into everyday solutions to increase the quality of life and wellbeing for older adults. His most recent role has enabled him to speak on a global stage about key issues such as dementia, housing and social care, concepts of frailty and, as today, attitudes towards older people.</p>

<p>Paul’s work on attitudes and the consequential behaviours has resulted in several international research collaborations where he is currently working to develop an educational tool to reduce ageism. In research, teaching and external consultancy, Paul has engaged with people on a number of topics, sharing his expertise in research methods, psychology and gerontology alike. It is this ability to communicate that has enabled Paul to achieve a lot in a comparatively short period of time. </p>

<p>In addition to his busy academic life, in his spare time, Paul is an enthusiastic supporter of disability sport. He is an international athletics official which is resulting in his being part of both the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic games in London this summer.</p>

	<p>Robyn Flipse is a registered dietitian specializing in nutrition communications. Having spent her career in dietetics as a counselor, teacher, writer and media spokesperson, she has become an important resource for easy-to-understand nutrition information and user-friendly suggestions to help make good eating habits part of healthy lifestyle.</p>

	<p>Upon graduation from Florida State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in dietetics, Robyn went on to earn her Master of Science degree in human nutrition and dietetics from Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey. She later returned to Rutgers University and earned a Master of Arts degree in cultural anthropology with a focus on the impact of contemporary societal changes on eating behavior. Most of Robyn’s career has been devoted to a diverse private practice where she provided medical nutrition therapy to individuals and small groups in central New Jersey for over 25 years. She has also served as a consultant to several global food and pharmaceutical companies and on the adjunct faculty at both the university and community college level. Robyn has expertise in the areas of sweeteners and energy balance, childhood nutrition, and the role of functional foods in Dietary Guidelines.</p>

	<p>Throughout her career Robyn has contributed expert commentary to national publications and media outlets, such as CNN, The New York Times, and SELF, plus numerous affiliate television and radio stations reached in her satellite and ground media tours. She is the author of many popular consumer diet and nutrition books, including The Wedding Dress Diet and Fighting the Freshman Fifteen, and several magazine, newsletter and web site articles.</p>

	<p>Volunteering has been a parallel pursuit to Robyn’s professional career. She has devoted her time to the Monmouth-Ocean County FoodBank, Trinity Church Saturday Soup Kitchen and the Two River Theater Company to name a few of her favorite groups. She is a native of the Jersey Shore and now makes her home in Bradley Beach where she tends a large organic vegetable garden and a yard full of purple perennial flowers. </p>
